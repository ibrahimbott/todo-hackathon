# The Evolution of Todo (Hackathon II) Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven First
Har feature pehle specs/ mein define hoga; code sirf AI generate karega. All features must be defined in the specs/ directory before any code implementation begins. Code generation must be handled exclusively by AI to ensure consistency and traceability.

### Architectural Evolution
System ko simple CLI se distributed cloud-native AI system mein evolve karna hai. The system architecture must evolve from a simple CLI application to a distributed, cloud-native AI system with scalability and resilience in mind.

### Reusable Intelligence
Subagents aur Agent Skills ka istemal karke infrastructure aur logic ko automate karna hai. Infrastructure and business logic must be automated using subagents and Agent Skills to ensure reusability and maintainability.

### Technology Standards Compliance
Backend: Python 3.13+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless DB. Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Better Auth. AI & Cloud: OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP SDK, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka (Redpanda), Dapr. All implementations must adhere to these specified technology standards.

### Success Criteria Adherence
Zero manual boilerplate code, 100% Traceability (Spec se Task tak), Multi-language support (English & Urdu). The project must achieve zero manual boilerplate code, maintain 100% traceability from specs to tasks, and support multi-language (English & Urdu).

### Zero Manual Boilerplate
No manual creation of boilerplate code is allowed. All boilerplate must be generated automatically through tools, templates, or AI assistance to maintain consistency and reduce development time.

## Additional Standards

Backend technologies must use Python 3.13+ with FastAPI for APIs, SQLModel for database models, and Neon Serverless DB for persistence. Frontend must use Next.js 16+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Better Auth for authentication. AI and cloud infrastructure must leverage OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP SDK, Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestration, Kafka (Redpanda) for streaming, and Dapr for distributed systems.

## Development Workflow

All development must follow the Spec-Driven approach where features are defined in specs/ before implementation. Code must be AI-generated following the defined standards. All changes must maintain 100% traceability from specification to implementation tasks. Multi-language support (English & Urdu) must be considered in all user-facing components.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All amendments must be documented with proper approval and migration plans. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. All development must follow the Spec-Driven approach as defined in the guidance documentation.
